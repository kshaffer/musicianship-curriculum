## Course sequence overview ##

This document contains the foundational objectives of the Musicianship curriculum at Charleston Southern University.

The four-semester Musicianship course sequence seeks to lead students to become well-rounded musicians, with a strong foundation in the theory and practice of Western music. Given the fast changing landscape of musical careers, the best training involves mastery of skills with broad applicability, coupled with deep knowledge of a variety of musical genres and experience applying skills and knowledge to new genres. With that in mind, the CSU Musicianship courses seek to lay a solid, broad foundation, and explore several different musical styles in detail.

On the whole, this goal is achieved by bringing students to a deep understanding of music theory and its relationship to musical practice. The CSU Musicianship courses also seek to develop students' mastery of foundational musical skills relating to listening and performing, and develop students' ability to think critically and communicate verbally about music, primarily through writing about music and responding to the writings of others. Lastly, students are expected to master the use of both traditional and modern technology (including pencil, paper, and the piano on one hand, and computer- and web-based tools on the other) in their musical activities and grow in their ability to discern the best tools for specific tasks.

These courses make use of what is called *standards-based*, *learning objectives-based*, *mastery-based*, or *criterion-referenced* assessment. Rather than assigning homework, tests, and quizzes throughout the semester and averaging the grades of that work (with some work weighted more heavily than other work), the CSU Musicianship courses are designed around a list of learning and mastery objectives. When students demonstrate internalization of a particular unit of knowledge or mastery of a particular skill, they receive credit for that objective. Passing each course with final grades of A, B, or C depend on the extent to which students have mastered the course objectives by the end of the semester.

In the following parts of this document, these objectives are laid out for the entire Musicianship sequence. *Conceptual* objectives are provided first. These objectives guide curriculum decisions and classroom approaches, but are not the basis of assessment. The following section lays out *holistic* objectives. These are high-level objectives that each represent a summation of a number of lower-level *content* objectives, provided in the final section. At any time in the course, students may attempt a *holistic* assessment, which will also cover a large number of *content* objectives. However, most students will find that following the *content* objectives one or two at a time will bring them most directly and smoothly to the ability to achieve mastery of a *holistic* objective. Both *holistic* and *content* objectives will be assessed to determine students' progress and final grades.

## Content overview ##

The Musicianship course sequence begins with a focus primarily on fundamental concepts (scales, keys, etc.), notation, and listening and performance skills (singing, playing at the keyboard, and dictating). As the course sequence progresses, the focus shifts gradually more toward theory, analysis, and writing. The musical genres covered in detail include pop/rock and contemporary Christian worship music (semester 2); classical keyboard music and Lutheran chorales (semester 3); and German Romantic art song, post-tonal music (primarily aural skills), and American minimalism (semester 4). Species counterpoint and *thoroughbass* harmony are also covered in detail (semester 2) in preparation for specific genre-based study later in the sequence.

The level of detail in the *content* objectives also decreases over the four semesters, giving students increasing responsibility for discerning and managing the steps necessary to fulfilling the *holistic* objectives.

In addition to specifically musical activities, students will be required to maintain a public blog on music throughout the entire course sequence. Students will write regularly on their own blog, read and comment on the blogs of their classmates, critically evaluate comments received, and revise some of their writings based on the comments they determine to be helpful.
