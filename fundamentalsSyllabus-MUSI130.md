# General course description #

> Course title: Introduction to Music  
Course number: MUSI 130  
Meeting time: MTWR 10:15am–12:15pm  
Meeting location: Whittington Hall, room 109  
Professor: Kris Shaffer, Ph.D.

The purpose of this course is to gain familiarity and fluency with basic musical structures and practices—in particular, reading music, performing music, and listening to music.


# Course objectives #

Following is a list of specific musical skills that students are expected to master by the end of the course. Full mastery of all skills will merit an A for the course. Sufficient mastery of all skills will merit a B for the course. Sufficient mastery of most skills will merit a C for the course.

Students who demonstrate sufficient mastery of all skills (final grade of B) will automatically qualify for Musicianship I (MUSI 198) without taking the CSU Musicianship entrance exam. Students who demonstrate mastery of most skills (C) or who fail the course will be required to pass the CSU Musicianship entrance exam before registering for Musicianship I.

# Assessment #

There are 41 course objectives listed above. 23 course objectives are reading- and writing-related; 18 are performance-related (singing or playing at the piano).

Reading and writing objectives will be assessed through in-class timed quizzes. We will have multiple quiz opportunities per class meeting. To pass a reading or writing objective, a student must perform up to standard on two separate quizzes for the same objective.

Performance objectives will be assessed through private singing or playing exams conducted during class. To pass a performance objective, a student must perform up to standard on a single exam.

Multiple attempts are allowed for any objective until the student meets the required standard.

To pass the course (grade of C), the student must receive passing assessments for at least 18 of the 23 reading and writing objectives and 14 of the 18 performance objectives.

For a final grade of B, the student must receive passing assessments for all objectives. 

For a final grade of A, the student must receive passing assessments for all course objectives and demonstrate *mastery* of a majority of assessments. For this calculation, performance-related objectives count as double. (Considering reading and writing assessments as one point each, and performance as two, the student must demonstrate mastery on 30 points out of a total 59 possible to receive an A.)


# Attendance #

In general, there are not excused or unexcused absences in this class. Any material covered or assignment given during class is the responsibility of every student, regardless of attendance or reason, and there are no make-ups for in-class evaluations. However, students with a note from a doctor or a dean will be allowed to make up missed work, as necessary. In exceptional circumstances, other arrangements may be made at the discretion of the instructor. In all cases, if a student knows beforehand that they will be absent or late for any reason, it is that student's responsibility to find out what work will need to be made up before the absence.

In accordance with CSU's Academic Integrity Policy (see 2011–2012 Student Handbook for complete policy), any student who is absent for 25% of the class meetings will be dropped from the course and will receive a grade of FA (Failure for Absences). All absences count toward the 25%, including excused absences and absences resulting from officially approved travel or events (sports, athletic bands, etc.).

# Academic honesty #

Group study is acceptable and encouraged in this class. However, all assignments—unless I announce otherwise—are to be completed by individuals, and are to be the original work of those individuals. It is fine for classmates to check each other's work for errors, train each other's ears, and discuss potential solutions to sticky musical situations with one another; however copying, working off of another's work, or producing a "joint solution" are unacceptable. The instructor reserves the right to assign a grade of zero to any assignment that is completed dishonestly, fail the student for the course, and/or proceed with completion of the university Academic Violation Form. (See 2011–2012 *Student Handbook* for complete Academic Integrity Policy.)
