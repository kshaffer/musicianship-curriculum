The following are objectives that each student should accomplish by the end of the four-semester Musicianship course sequence. This document contains objectives related to music fundamentals and objectives designed to build skills and knowledge necessary to fulfill the *holistic* objectives for the course sequence. Meeting a holistic objective simultaneously demonstrates mastery of a number of content objectives.
