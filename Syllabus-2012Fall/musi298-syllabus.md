# Course sequence overview #

The four-semester Musicianship course sequence seeks to lead students to become well-rounded musicians, with a strong foundation in the theory and practice of Western music. Given the fast changing landscape of musical careers, the best training involves mastery of skills with broad applicability, coupled with deep knowledge of a variety of musical genres and experience applying skills and knowledge to new genres. With that in mind, the CSU Musicianship courses seek to lay a solid, broad foundation, and explore several different musical styles in detail.

On the whole, this goal is achieved by bringing students to a deep understanding of music theory and its relationship to musical practice. The CSU Musicianship courses also seek to develop students' mastery of foundational musical skills relating to listening and performing, and develop students' ability to think critically and communicate verbally about music, primarily through writing about music and responding to the writings of others. Lastly, students are expected to master the use of both traditional and modern technology (including pencil, paper, and the piano on one hand, and computer- and web-based tools on the other) in their musical activities and grow in their ability to discern the best tools for specific tasks.

The Musicianship course sequence begins in the first semester with a focus primarily on fundamental concepts (scales, keys, etc.), notation, and listening and performance skills (singing, playing at the keyboard, and dictating). As the course sequence progresses, the focus shifts gradually more toward theory, analysis, and writing. The musical genres covered in detail include pop/rock and contemporary Christian worship music (semester 2); classical keyboard music and Lutheran chorales (semester 3); and German Romantic art song, post-tonal music (primarily aural skills), and American minimalism (semester 4). Species counterpoint and *thoroughbass* harmony are also covered in detail (semester 2) in preparation for specific genre-based study later in the sequence.

The following objectives describe the conceptual knowledge about Western music sought in this course sequence. They will not form the basis of any student assessment, but will guide the curriculum and assessment choices made by the instructor.

* Understand the principles of good melodic composition.
* Understand the principles of good interaction between musical voices.
* Understand the significance and potential roles of of melody in setting text to music.
* Understand the significance and potential roles of of harmony in setting text to music.
* Understand the significance and potential roles of of form in setting text to music.
* Understand basic formal functions and formal modules, as well as the relationship between them.
* Understand harmonic functions and their relationship to formal functions.
* Identify key markers of a musical style.
* Communicate verbally about music, clearly and persuasively.
* Understand the relationships of different genres within Western tonal music.
* Apply skills and knowledge gained in the study of one genre to the study of a new genre.
* Critically evaluate and respond to others' thoughts on music, and do so respectfully.
* Understand the relationships between the theory, practice, and history of music.

# Assessment #

Fundamentals and technology assessments have two possible results: *pass* or *fail*. All other categories will be assessed on a four-point scale: 4 = *mastery*, 3 = *passing*, 2 = *progressing but not passing*, 1 = *failing*, and 0 = *not attempted*.

Fundamentals objectives will be assessed through in-class timed quizzes. To pass a fundamentals objective, a student must perform up to standard on a single quiz.

Performance objectives will be assessed through private singing or playing exams conducted during class. To pass a performance objective, a student must perform up to standard on a single exam *and continue to perform up to standard on subsequent assessments that include related material*.

Analysis objectives will all be assessed through tasks performed in class or assignments performed in music notation or analysis software and submitted online. To pass an analysis objective, a student must perform up to standard on one in-class test or two take-home assessments for the same objective in a row *and continue to perform up to standard on subsequent assessments that include related material*.

Writing objectives will all be assessed through the student's blog posts, comments, and revisions. To pass a *content* writing objective, a student must meet the requirements listed above for that specific objective. To pass the *holistic* writing objectives (except for the one relating specifically to comments), a student must submit a portfolio of blog posts (minimum of two). Any objective met by all posts in the portfolio will be considered *passing*. New or revised posts can be submitted later in order to fulfill remaining objectives; however, those new posts must also meet the objectives already passed in order to retain a passing mark for that category. In other words, the *last two posts submitted* must meet all objectives in order to pass all objectives for the semester. The holistic writing objective "write constructive critical responses to classmates' writings on music" will be evaluated in terms of comments left on classmates' blogs. Students can choose five comments they would like to be evaluated for this objective, at least three of which must come after midterm (October 5). If a student does not choose comments for evaluation, I will evaluate the five most recent comments as of the last day of classes. Students are strongly encouraged to submit a blog portfolio well in advance of the end of the semester in case significant revisions are necessary.

The technology objectives will be assessed through assignments submitted online. To pass a technology objective, a student must perform up to standard on a single assessment *and continue to perform up to standard on subsequent assessments that include related material*.

Assessments can be attempted at any time by any student. Multiple attempts are allowed for any objective until the student meets the required standard (*pass* for pass/fail objectives, score of 3 or 4 for four-point objectives). However, *no content objective assessments (including reassessments) can be attempted during finals week* unless they are part of a holistic objective assessment. *Only holistic assessments can be attempted after the end of the last class meeting*.

There is no final exam.


# Final grades #

To pass the course (grade of C), a student must receive passing assessments for all fundamentals and components objectives, and at least 80% of the objectives *in each of the other categories*.

For a final grade of B, a student must receive passing assessments for all objectives. 

For a final grade of A, a student must receive passing assessments for all course objectives and demonstrate *mastery* of a majority of four-point assessments.

Any objectives not met by a passing student at the end of the semester will carry over to Musicianship IV as *required* objectives that must be met to pass the course, no matter how many other objectives are fulfilled.


# Attendance #

In general, there are not excused or unexcused absences in this class. Any material covered or assignment given during class is the responsibility of every student, regardless of attendance or reason, and there are no make-ups for in-class evaluations. However, students with a note from a doctor or a dean will be allowed to make up missed work, as necessary. In exceptional circumstances, other arrangements may be made at the discretion of the instructor. In all cases, if a student knows beforehand that they will be absent or late for any reason, it is that student's responsibility to find out what work will need to be made up before the absence.

In accordance with CSU's Academic Integrity Policy (see 2011–2012 *Student Handbook* for complete policy), any student who is absent for 25% of the class meetings will be dropped from the course and will receive a grade of FA (Failure for Absences). All absences count toward the 25%, including excused absences and absences resulting from officially approved travel or events (sports, athletic bands, etc.).

# Academic honesty #

Group study is acceptable and encouraged in this class. However, all assignments—unless I announce otherwise—are to be completed by individuals, and are to be the original work of those individuals. It is fine for classmates to check each other's work for errors, train each other's ears, and discuss potential solutions to sticky musical situations with one another; however copying, working off of another's work, or producing a "joint solution" are unacceptable. The instructor reserves the right to assign a grade of zero to any assignment that is completed dishonestly, fail the student for the course, and/or proceed with completion of the university Academic Violation Form. (See 2011–2012 *Student Handbook* for complete Academic Integrity Policy.)
