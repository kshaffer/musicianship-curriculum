Final grades for Musicianship III will be determined according to the following six criteria: *classical form – conceptual understanding*, *classical form – aural analysis*, *keyboard harmony*, *chromatic harmony*, *writing*, and *music and the Christian faith*.

Each criterion will be assessed on a four-point scale: *mastery* (4), *working knowledge* (3), *incomplete understanding* (2), *poor understanding* (1), and *no significant attempt made* (0).

Mastery of four or more criteria, with working knowledge of the rest, will qualify a student for an end-of-semester A. Working knowledge of all criteria will qualify a student for an end-of-semester B. Working knowledge of four or more criteria, with incomplete understanding of the rest, will qualify a student for a C. Poor understanding or no attempt for any criterion will result in a failing end-of-semester grade (D or F).

I will create a report for these criteria for each student in DropBox and provide current evaluations based on work to date. Students can then consult with me to discuss what task(s) can be performed by finals week to meet any remaining criteria.


## Classical form – conceptual understanding ##

A student must demonstrate a conceptual understanding of the formal units, events, and functions in classical minuets and sonata-form movements.

## Classical form – aural analysis ##

A student must demonstrate an ability to identify the above formal units, events, and functions by ear and without a score.

## Keyboard harmony ##

A student must demonstrate an ability to realize standard tonal-harmonic progressions at the keyboard from a thoroughbass line. Diatonic progressions are sufficient for *working knowledge*, but chromatic harmonies are required for *mastery*.

## Chromatic harmony ##

A student must demonstrate an ability to identify chromatic chords in a diatonic context from a score (applied chords and chromatic subdominants) and an understanding of their typical role within a functional harmonic progression.

## Writing ##

A student must demonstrate an ability to write a short-form work on a musical topic that has a clear thesis and a logical argument without extraneous details.

## Music and the Christian faith ##

A student must demonstrate knowledge of Biblical teaching on music as it relates to either corporate Christian worship or the daily Christian life.
