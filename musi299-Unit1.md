# Unit I: German art song (January 7–February 11) #

Unit I will cover the following four topics:

- text-music relationships  
- harmonic syntax    
- melodic performance  
- harmonic listening    

Also included in this unit of study will be work that contributes to the semester-long *technology* and *writing about music* topics.

Assessments for the *text-music relationships* and *harmonic syntax* criteria will come from a single analysis/paper project due on Monday, February 11.

Final harmonic listening assessments will take place on *Tuesday, February 5*.

Final melodic performance assessments will take place on *Thursday, February 7*. (Students are encouraged to assess prior to that date.)

Work for each topic of study will be evaluated on a four-point scale: *mastery* (4), *working knowledge* (3), *incomplete understanding* (2), *poor understanding* (1), and *no significant attempt made* (0). Rubrics for each category are provided below. (For further information on how final grades are calculated, consult the course syllabus.)


# Assessment rubrics #

### Text-music relationships ###

The following will be demonstrated in a 1000–1500 word paper due at the end of the unit. (More details on the paper forthcoming on the course website.)

The objectives for this topic are for each student to be able to 1) describe the tone, voice, structure, meaning, imagery, sound, etc. of a Romantic poem in German (with the assistance of an English translation); 2) describe the formal structure of the musical setting and any text-painting devices employed by the composer; 3) describe the composer's interpretation of the poem based on his/her musical setting of it; and 4) interpret the composer's interpretations by critically evaluating it in light of *your* interpretation of the text and other interpretive and musical possibilities available to the composer.

Your grade for this criterion will simply be the number of these objectives you demonstrate in your paper. If you can clearly describe the main features of the poem and music but do not interpret, you get a 2. If you also accurately describe the composer's interpretation, you get a 3. If you can also offer a nuanced interpretation of the composer's interpretation in light of other possibilities, you get a 4.


### Harmonic syntax ###

The objective for this topic of study is to cap our study of harmonic syntax in tonal music, with each student able to perform an accurate thoroughbass reduction of a piece of music that involves diatonic and chromatic elements, modal mixture, and modulation.

Grades for this criterion will be assigned according to the following rubric.

*Mastery (4)* – Student can produce a thoroughbass reduction (bass and figures) of a German art song, with a functional bass analysis *and* a Roman numeral analysis, with all modulations labeled by type, typeset in music notation software with minimal errors.

*Working knowledge (3)* – Same as *mastery*, but with more than minimal errors.

*Incomplete knowledge (2)* – Student demonstrates fundamental misunderstanding of one or more conceptual elements (functions, mixture, proper nomenclature, chordal roots, etc.) or makes substantial errors in analysis (such as long passages analyzed in an incorrect key) or moderate errors in reduction.

*Poor knowledge (1)* – Student demonstrates fundamental misunderstanding of multiple conceptual elements or an inability to reduce art song texture to a thoroughbass line.

*No significant attempt made (0)* – Student does not submit a complete analysis project on time, or demonstrates knowledge below passing level for Elementary Theory II.


### Melodic performance ###

The objective for this category is for each student to be able to sing from sight a melody in any standard key or meter that includes standard chromatic figures and/or modulates to a closely related key.

Grades for this criterion will be assigned according to the following rubric.

*Mastery (4)* – Student can sing, with minimal errors, from sight a 4–8-bar-long melody in any standard key or meter that includes standard chromatic figures and/or modulates to a closely related key.

*Working knowledge (3)* – Student can sing, with moderate errors, from sight a 4–8-bar-long melody in any standard key or meter that includes standard chromatic figures and/or modulates to a closely related key.

*Incomplete knowledge (2)* – Student has working knowledge or mastery level ability for either chromatics or modulation, but significant trouble with the other.

*Poor knowledge (1)* – Student has significant difficulty with chromatics and modulation, or noticeable difficulty with rhythm or diatonic elements.

*No significant attempt made (0)* – Student does not assess this objective or performs below passing level for Aural Skills II.


### Harmonic listening ###

The objective for harmonic listening is for all students to listen to a phrase-long chord progression that includes chromatic chords and reliably dictate four elements—melody, bass line, functional bass, and thoroughbass figures. 

Since there are four elements, grades will be determined by the number of elements a student can reliably dictate after three or four hearings.

*Mastery (4)* – Student can dictate all four elements with minimal errors after three or four hearings.

*Working knowledge (3)* – Student can dictate three elements with minimal errors, or two elements with minimal errors and two elements with moderate errors. *Or* student can reliably perform at *mastery* level, but only with more than four hearings.

*Incomplete knowledge (2)* – Student can dictate two elements with minimal errors, or one with minimal errors and two with moderate errors. *Or* student can perform at *working knowledge* level, but only with more than four hearings.

*Poor knowledge (1)* – Student can dictate one element with minimal errors, or two with moderate errors. *Or* student can perform at *incomplete knowledge* level, but only with more than four hearings.

*No significant attempt made (0)* – Student does not assess this objective or performs below passing level for Aural Skills II.
